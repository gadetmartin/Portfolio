### Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a complete database for an organization with accessible data. After a brief brainstorming session, we chose the basketball club of my teammate as the organization.  
After my teammate collected data from the club leader, we created the conceptual data model ([MCD.jpg](MCD.jpg)) using Looping software and the relational schema ([SR.jpg](SR.jpg)) using the MOCODO website.  
Using MySQL, we started to create the database and insert data with SQL insertion files. At the end of this process, we checked that the database was functional by making SQL queries on it.
