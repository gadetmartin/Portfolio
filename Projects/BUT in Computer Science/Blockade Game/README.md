### Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a complete 3D board game from start to finish in a team of 15 students. We were divided into smaller teams, each responsible for a part of the game.  
I was part of the HCI team, whose objective was to create the game board, the menus, and animate everything. I personally took care of the game's start menus.
