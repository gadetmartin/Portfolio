# 📂 BUT in Computer Science Projects

> Most and even all project in BUT in Computer Science will be in **French** due to the fact that this Bachelor is in **French**.

The BUT in Computer Science is a multidisciplinary program covering many areas of IT, including databases, AI, HCI, and web technologies. Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to learn several programming languages such as C++, C#, HTML, Java, Python, SQL, and more. We also carried out diverse projects to apply this knowledge in practice while developing soft skills such as teamwork, autonomy, creativity, and problem-solving.
