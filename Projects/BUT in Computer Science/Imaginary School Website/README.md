### Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a website for an imaginary school. We were asked to imagine our dream school and build its website. I personally imagined a school specialized in video games, including professors, a director, courses, locations, etc. The school was designed to feel real. I then created the website page by page and finished with CSS to style everything.
