### Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a functional AI. We chose to develop an AI to detect objects in a video. To do this, we first found an apple image dataset on the Kaggle website. I personally labeled all of the apple images. Then, using YoloV8 tutorials, we trained our model on the dataset. After training, we ran detection on a video that showed many apples. As you will see in this [video](https://youtu.be/GhGpk1ro9mU), the detection was quite good, but sometimes the model detected an apple where there was none. This is due to a lack of labeled images and training. With more images and more training time, the results would be better.
