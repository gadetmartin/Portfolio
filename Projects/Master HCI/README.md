# 📂 Master HCI Projects 

> Most and even all project in Master HCI will be in **English** due to the fact that this Master is in **English**.

After completing a BUT in Computer Science, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction. This field of IT has always interested me, as it allows me to connect two passions: computer science and design.  
During this Master’s program, I specialized in various approaches to Human-Computer Interaction, such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, gesture-based interactions, tangible interactions, and the improvement of user experience in existing functionalities.  
We also worked on several projects that taught us the full design process, including brainstorming, sketching, scenario building, prototyping, video creation, user testing, literature reviews, and research paper writing.
